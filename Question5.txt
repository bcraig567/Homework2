Bobby Craig, Homework 2, Question 5

If a robot (let's say robot 1), is immediately assigned a new task after
finishing the first one, there might end up being an unequal distribution
of the work needed to be done by the robots. What this could mean is the 
deterioration of the robot doing most of the work, meaning replacements would
be frequent. Furthermore, the code has a higher likelihood of breaking if we only
give one of the robots something to do, which could result in inefficiency with our
robots.

To fix this, I would introduce a cooldown period, something like a timer, to give time to
allow the robots to reset and recuperate. The timing of such would be dependent on certain factors
such as whether the robot had a hard task or not, how long it took to complete said task, and others.
